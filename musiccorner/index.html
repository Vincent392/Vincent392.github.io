        <i><p>What insturments do I play?</p></i>

        <p>I play the bass and I mess around with Guitar and Keyboards too, I would count myself as a Guitar player since I do actually play or learn shit, such as Assassin, I've tried Halo on Fire and that James Rhythm figure durinf the verses... my god.

<i><p>Who are your bass influences?</p></i>

<p>My main bass influences would be <b>Cliff Burton</b>, <b>Chris Wolstenholme</b>, <b>Tim Comford</b>, <b>Jason Newsted</b> and <b>Steve Harris</b>.</p>

<i><p>Who are your guitar influences?</p></i>

<p>My main influences would Probably be Matthew Bellamy, Tony Iommi and James Hetfield as of now.</p>

		<i><p>Who are they?</p></i>
		<p>Search them up, and if you're a metalhead but don't know who Steve Harris is, what rock have you been living under?</p>

		<i><p>What gear do you own?</p></i>
		<p>Currently I own a Blackstar U30 Amplifier that kicks ass.</p>

<p>I own two Basses, those being an Ibanez SR300 PJ in Dark Blue tuned to standard usually and A Johnson Fender Jazz Bass Clone usually tuned to D#.</p>

<p>And in terms of my board, it's an Boss ODB-3, a CryBaby Q105 Bass Wah, A Bass Big Muff Deluxe and a MXR Bass Octave Deluxe, in the following chain:</p>

<p>Bass->Wah->Octave->Phaser->Muff->ODB->Amp</p>

       <p>If you have more questions about my gear, send em to Legovincent@proton.me</p>
